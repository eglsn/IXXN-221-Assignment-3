    <h1>Week 2</h1>
    <h3>What did I learn today in class?</h3>
    <p>I learnt about web design from 1990 -1998 and creating a User persona to help make sure that the website is designed for and considers the needs of the target audience.
        This week we had the first coding lecture, where we learnt about HTML basics. We learnt how to create the start of a basic website, we learnt how to change the website title, add a heading, a subheading, paragraph, and how to upload or link a image.</p>
    <h3>What did I find interesting?</h3>
    <p>I found the Geocities interesting as it is so different to how the internet is now, it shows the progress that has been made. </p>
    <h3>How can it be applied in web design?</h3>
    <p>It can be applied to web design as it is a good reminder that improvement comes with time, learning and experiments. Starting my web design journey I need to give myself the time and not hold myself to a high expectation as a beginner. </p>
    <h3>How did it influence me as a designer?</h3>
    <p>The concept of Geocities influences my ideas about what can be created and how communities can be formed. The User personas helps me with ensuring that my design process will create the best user experience on my website. </p>

    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <h3>What did I learn today in class?</h3>
    <p>I learnt about web design from 1998 - 2008, it was really interesting to see the improvements made throughout the years from the early basic web design to the web design we have today. We also learnt about the importance of web design and how setting goals is an important step in the design process. In the coding lecture, we learnt how to use a anchor tag to link text and images. We also learnt how to create HTML lists, unordered and ordered lists, list item tags</p>
    <h3>What did I find interesting?</h3>
    <p>I thought The Million Dollar Homepage was an interesting concept, as it is was a profitable idea but is also very overwhelming due to the amount of links in a small area, which would make it hard to navigate. </p>
    <h3>How can it be applied in web design?</h3>
    <p>It can be applied to web design as it shows us that as web designers we need to ensure that our design is functional and easy to navigate, and we can ensure our design is successful by following goals that we set to make the user experience positive. </p>
    <h3>How did it influence me as a designer?</h3>
    <p>This has influenced me as it reminds me that when I am designing I need to ensure that my designs meet user goals to create a positive user experience by stepping out of the designer role and viewing my design through a user perspective. </p>

    <h1>Week 4</h1>
    <h3>What did I learn today in class?</h3>
    <p>We learnt today about web design from 2009 - present. We also learnt about customer journey maps and user flow and how it is an important part of the design process to get the best understanding of how we can improve the user experience through our designs. 
        In the coding lecture, we learnt how to make CSS box bubbles. We learnt how to make an index page and a CSS page. This taught us how to customise our website by changing the background colour and size of the background box behind a text. We also learnt how to change the size of an image, and adding a background colour around the image by adding padding.</p>
    <h3>What did I find interesting?</h3>
    <p>I thought the Corporate Memphis art style was interesting as I see it regularly and is an art style that I like but wasn't aware that it was the style's name. This style comes up a lot when I search for design ideas and inspiration on platforms like Pinterest. </p>
    <h3>How can it be applied in web design?</h3>
    <p>It can be applied to web design because art like Corporate Memphis provides the designs with another element that adds a fun extra to the design so that the design is not just words. </p>
    <h3>How did it influence me as a designer?</h3>
    <p>Corporate Memphis has previously influenced my design as I take a lot of inspiration from its art style and how it is placed/positioned in the websites or apps. </p>

    <h1>Week 5</h1>
    <h3>What did I learn today in class?</h3>
    <p>In the coding lecture, we learnt about divs and flex boxes which are empty boxes that can be edited in CSS. We also learnt about CSS grids which are the structures used to display content in the website.</p>
    <h3>What did I find interesting?</h3>
    <p>I found learning about how to code this interesting, I didn't expect that I would enjoy learning about coding as much as I actually do. I like the challenge that comes with figuring out all the code and the problems. It makes you more aware of everything that actually goes into designing a website. </p>
    <h3>How can it be applied in web design?</h3>
    <p>This can be applied to web design as it is a part of coding for web design, so as designers we can use this knowledge that we learn and use it in our web designs. </p>
    <h3>How did it influence me as a designer?</h3>
    <p>This influences me as a designer as learning about coding has opened up another part of the design world. It has made me realise the opportunities and abilities I have as a designer, and that I should always learn about new ways I can use my design skills like how I am learning to code.</p>

    <h1>Week 6</h1>
    <h3>What did I learn today in class?</h3>
    <p>We learnt about colour and typography. In the coding lecture, we learned about GitHub and how to use it. </p>
    <h3>What did I find interesting?</h3>
    <p>I found the Who Can Use website interesting as it enables you to see if your colour choices for a website are able to be seen or how they are seen by people who are visually impaired. </p>
    <h3>How can it be applied in web design?</h3>
    <p>This can be applied to web design as it is an important factor when creating a website as colours play a big role in the aesthetic of the website. By choosing colours that work with the website and for people who are visually impaired it will make the website more accessible and so everyone can experience a similar website experience. </p>
    <h3>How did it influence me as a designer?</h3>
    <p>This influences me as a designer as this will be something that will become part of my design process, because its important to make a website as accessible and inclusive to all people as possible. </p>

    <h1>Week 7</h1>
    <h3>What did I learn today in class?</h3>
    <p>We learnt about the composition of websites, how different factors and components shape the website. We also learnt about affordances, which are parts of the design that show the user how to use it. </p>
    <h3>What did I find interesting?</h3>
    <p>I found the affordances interesting, although the components of affordances seem to be obvious parts of the design the purpose and how they guide the user through the site are really important and a crucial part of the design which I didn't understand how important and useful affordances are as designers. It has opened my eyes to details that I didn't really consider before.  </p>
    <h3>How can it be applied in web design?</h3>
    <p>This can be applied to web design because affordances can be applied to all parts of the web design to help guide the user through the website, which makes it easier for the user to navigate.</p>
    <h3>How did it influence me as a designer?</h3>
    <p>I will now be implementing affordances into my designs to achieve successful navigation and functionality to create the best user experience possible. </p>

    <h3>What did I find interesting?</h3>
    <p>I found it interesting how we need to consider how our web design works for different screen sizes. I thought this was interesting because we can use code to make sure our design works on different screen sizes, this is something that was new to me.</p>
    <h3>How can it be applied in web design?</h3>
    <p>This can be applied to web design because as designers we need to make sure our design can be accessed by everyone so that our design is accessible to people on every device.</p>
    <h3>How did it influence me as a designer?</h3>
    <p>I will now be using the code to make sure all my websites are able to work on all screen sizes, because it is an important factor that can impact how people view and are able to access my web designs.</p>
